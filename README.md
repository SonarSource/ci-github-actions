# ci-github-actions

[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=SonarSource_ci-github-actions&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=SonarSource_ci-github-actions)

CI/CD GitHub Actions

## ðŸ“‹ Standardization & Requirements

All actions in this repository follow standardized patterns for consistency and maintainability. Key standardizations include:

### Required Inputs

- **`repox-url`**: Required for all build actions (default: `https://repox.jfrog.io`)
- **`develocity-url`**: Required for Gradle and Maven build actions (default: `https://develocity.sonar.build/`)

### Standardized Environment Variables

All actions use consistent environment variables with safe fallback patterns (`|| ''` instead of `false` or `null`):

- `PULL_REQUEST`: Pull request number or empty string
- `PULL_REQUEST_SHA`: Pull request base SHA or empty string
- `DEFAULT_BRANCH`: Repository default branch name

### Event Detection

Actions use `$GITHUB_EVENT_NAME` environment variable for reliable pull request detection instead of legacy string comparison patterns.

---

## `get-build-number`

Manage the build number in GitHub Actions.

The GitHub status check is named `get-build-number`.

### Requirements

#### Required GitHub Permissions

- `id-token: write`
- `contents: read`

#### Required Vault Permissions

- `build-number`: GitHub preset to read and write the build number property. This is built-in to the Vault `auth.github` permission.

### Usage

```yaml

  get-build-number:
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04-large
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: SonarSource/ci-github-actions/get-build-number@v1
```

### Inputs

No inputs are required for this action.

### Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|

## Using AI for Cirrus CI to GitHub Actions Migration

It is recommended to use AI tools like Cursor or Claude code to assist with Cirrus CI to GitHub actions migration.
This repository contains a comprehensive guide to be passed as a context to AI. The guide is shared with Sonar developers using Cursor,
accessible using `@Doc` tag.

See the [documentation](https://xtranet-sonarsource.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/Platform/pages/2639560710/Migration+From+Cirrus+CI+-+GitHub)
for details on how to use it.
